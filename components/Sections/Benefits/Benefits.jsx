          Benefits of the Spanish Digital Nomad Visa
        </h2>
        <p className="paragraph text-center text-black">
          The new Spanish Digital Nomad Visa makes it a very attractive
          destination for digital nomads â€” easy to get with low income
          requirements, minimal bureaucracy and renewal up to 5 years. Whether
          you pick a buzzing city like Barcelona or a charming pueblo, Spain
          dishes up the work-travel balance in spades with an enviable quality
          of life.
